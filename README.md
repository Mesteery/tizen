# TizenOS WebApp typings

This package contains the (complete) typing of Tizen WebApp API.
These types are autogenerated from the WebIDL definitions of Tizen,
from https://github.com/Samsung/tizen-docs.

If you find an problem or have a question, do not hesitate to open an issue.

## Installation & Usage

```console
npm install -D tizen
```

In your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
	"compilerOptions": {
		"types": ["tizen/types/<version>/<platform>"]
	}
}
```

Normally, after performing these steps, you should have `tizen` typed:

```ts
const { name } = tizen.application.getAppInfo(); // or window.tizen
alert(`Application name is ${name}`);
```
